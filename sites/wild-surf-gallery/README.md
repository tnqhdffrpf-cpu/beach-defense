# Wild & Salt Photo Builder

Open `index.html` and drag photos from Finder into the drop zone.

What it does:
- Reads EXIF metadata (lens, focal length, aperture, shutter, ISO, date/time) and shows it as caption chips.
- Tries in-browser subject detection and suggests an artsy title.

Notes:
- Subject detection needs internet the first time to load model files.
- Browser pages cannot directly save dropped files into this folder automatically; drop is for editing/preview workflow.
